## operating system
- os:
    - fetch instruction
    - decode
    - execute
    - repeat
- virtualization:
    - take a pysical
    - create a easy to use, virtual form
- os as resource manager
    - ilusion of very large number cpu
- virtual address
    - all program popinter memory at the same address,tapi ga crash?
- concurrency
    - akses resource bareng2
- protection
    - isolation

## virtualization
- illusion of many cpu
- time sharing of the cpu
- time sharing
- policies
- process
    - address space
    - stack pointer
    - frame pointer
    - IO
    - register
    - load the program laziliy
- file descriptor
    - input, output, error
- state process
    - running
    - ready
    - blocked ... ini kalo nunggu io

## concurrency
- TCB ... thread control block
- CSP .. cooperating sequential process
- mutex .. only single process update the critical section
